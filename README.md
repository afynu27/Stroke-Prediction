# Stroke-Prediction
This is the final project that my team and I have completed. We decided to use the stroke dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data). Our project involved conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis, preprocessing the data, and selecting suitable models. As a result, we built a Gradient Boosting Classifier model and utilized Streamlit for deployment.
